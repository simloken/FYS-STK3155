## This is all the code used in project 1. It's all written in Python 3.8.
>functions.py

contains all functions used in part1a, 1b etc..

>proj1a.py

answers the introductiory project questions like plotting an analytical franke function and reading MSE/R2 values.

>proj1b.py

everything using the bootstrap method. In other words: Bias Variance Trade off plots.

>proj1c.py

(almost) everything using the Cross Validation method. In other words: CV-plots for the Franke Function

>proj1d.py

plots the cross-validation MSE for our terrain data. Also tries to map it to a 3d plot, but this does not work sadly as I couldn't find a way to map our prediction z's onto a fitting mesh. Most of the code is there though, if that counts.
