## This is all the code

>exampleruns.py

These are just a bunch of example runs. Mostly runs I ran to retrieve most of the data showcased in the report itself. Can safely be disregarded if you'd rather just look at the code itself

>functions.py

The backbone of the most of the project. All classes and most functions are defined here. 

>main.py

The main part of the project. Filled with a bunch of functions that use material from functions.py to solve specific problems given or do stuff that is in someway helpful to the report/project.

All documentation can be found above a given class/function, including inputs and description.
