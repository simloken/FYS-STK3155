#All documentation can be found above a given class/function, including inputs and description.

>deprecated.py

The manual, non-sklearn Logistic Regression and its handler from project 2. Deprecated because it kept giving really poor result for any method other than normal gradient descent.

>functions.py

A few minor functions are defined here.

>handlers.py

The middleman between solvers.py and main.py. "Handles" all the inbetween work to keep main.py neat and tidy.

>main.py

The main part of the project. Contains the two functions used for all results.

>solvers.py

The backbone of everything in this project. This contains all the classes for all different methods used.
